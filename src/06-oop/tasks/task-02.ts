/**
 * A digital wallet application stores information about a user's account.
 * 
 * A wallet has:
 * - Owner name
 * - Wallet ID
 * - Balance
 * 
 * For example, Jude Bellingham creates a wallet with:
 * | Property        | Value           |
 * | --------------- | --------------- |
 * | Wallet ID       | WAL001          |
 * | Owner           | Harry Maguire   |
 * | Initial Balance | Rp500,000       |
 * 
 * The application allows the user to:
 * - Deposit money
 * - Withdraw money
 * - Check the current balance
 * However, the balance must not be changed directly from outside the class.
 * 
 * Student Tasks:
 * Create: class DigitalWallet
 * Use:
 * - private balance: number;
 * 
 * The class should provide public methods:
 * - deposit(amount)
 * - withdraw(amount)
 * - getBalance()
 * - showWalletInfo()
 * 
 * Business Rules
 * deposit():
 * - Amount must be greater than 0.
 * 
 * withdraw():
 * - Amount must be greater than 0.
 * - Amount cannot exceed the current balance.
